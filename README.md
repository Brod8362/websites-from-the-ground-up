# From the Ground Up

This document has the following goals:

- Explain how a "website" is made
- Explain how HTTP works
- Explain what a "static" vs "dynamic" site is, and describe their advantages/limitations
- Show how combining a few simple tools allows you to create complex functionality
- Explain modular principles, to maximize code reuse
- Show how unit testing can be used to ensure site functionality & detect breaking code changes

Fully functional examples for the three examples (static, static+htmx, dynamic+htmx) are provided for reference and visual aid.
